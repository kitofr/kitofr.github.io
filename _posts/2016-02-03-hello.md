So, I realized I wanted to start writing again. 
Not that I've been an extensive writer in the past, but 
I ideas keep popping up that I want to write down. Hence,
this blog.

OK, now as we got that figured out; what the heck am I going to blog about?
As mentioned, different inquiries keep coming back to me. Philosophical, technical
and various other subjects, such as health, learning, motivation. 

I hope you enjoy can inspire me to write more, and gain better insights on the subject
at hand. 

Cheers,
Kristoffer
