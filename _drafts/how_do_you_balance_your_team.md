title: How to balance your team
---

This time around I want to dwell into how to tackle teams that are
not yielding, collaborating or has some other dysfunction. Let us dig in to it.

I've had this idea for quite some time now, that teams needs to be balanced to perform at their peak.
Much like a sports team. So lets take a detour into lacrosse land. I was thinking soccer first, but that's to boring. 

### Some background on Lacrosse first. 
Lacrosse is a ball game played on a big green turf, with 10 players in each team. 
The team roughly consists of 1 goalie, 3 defenders, 3 mid fielders (midies) and 3 attack men.
The goal of the game is to toss a rubber ball into the goal of the other team more times
than them. Simple. 

To 'toss' a ball in lacrosse you need a stick. Different positions 
of the team requires different sticks. For example, the goalie has a large head on his 
stick, making it easier to catch balls. The defenders has longer sticks, which gives them
reach. Midies and attackers have short sticks, good for quick release and protection of the
ball.
Obviously different positions require a different skill set for best performance. 

#### Goalies
A goalie needs to have quite the reflexes and be a decent commander, as he yells out 
ball position and various strategies to the defense. 

#### Defenders
Defenders need be quick at backward pacing, good at checking sticks and reading out 
weak players. 

#### Mid fielders
Midies are the working dogs of the field. They play on both ends of the field, thus they require
stamina and endurance, as well as the skill to carry the ball from the defensive end to attack. 
They also need to know how execute the defensive as well as the offensive strategies agreed upon.

#### Attackers
Attackers need to be accurate and extremely quick handling the ball and shooting. They also need to 
learn offensive strategies and read their defenders.
