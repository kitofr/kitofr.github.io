title: Practice, practice and more practice!

## Imagine this.

You have a professional soccer team. The average player costs around $ 35 000 000. 
They have rocket high salaries and you need to acquire more money every month just
to keep em playing.  

Now, you bought them for a *decent* price, and you would like to get some kick back
of your investment in the long term. Maybe, that means you would like to win the 
series, sell of some of them at the end of the season etc. 

To protect your team and investment, you don't want them to become injured, sick 
or depressed. You've actually gone so far as to hire a nutritionist, doctor, 
chiropractor and various other people to make sure they stay *on top of their game*.

During game time you have the best coaches money can buy. They also have an extra
team of scouts, looking for new talent and scouting the competition.

You have approximately 3 ways of generating money off your team.

  1. Your players generate money through playing games. Cup, series and friendly games.
     That is where their value is reevaluated and you win price money. 
  2. Your team becomes successful and the value of the team rises.
  3. Advertising during game play on television.

Now imagine you banned practice. Practice does not generate any money, right.
Practice does not raise the value of the players, because they are only evaluated
while playing. The team doesn't *win* anything during practice, nor can you sell
any advertising on television during practice. *Useless*. 

## WAIT... say WHAT?
Most people coming into any profession knows that there's a path to excellence in
that area. There's no question that soccer players like [Zlatan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zlatan_Ibrahimovi%C4%87), 
artists like [Madonna](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Madonna_(entertainer)), painters, chess players et al
 do some kind of practice to keep their game sharp.
As a matter of fact. Practice is **most** of what they do.

When I grew up I used to play the guitar. After a couple of years fiddling, I became 
quite good. I ended up going to school at [SÃ¶dra Latins Gymnasium](http://sodralatinsgymnasium.stockholm.se/)
in Stockholm. During my years there I practiced about 3-8 hours per day. Every day. All week. 
For 3 years.

In comparison to that, I think I did around 20 concerts, which would roughly total a hefty 60-120 min of 
*game play*. 1 to 2 hours!

I think some mathematics is suitable here.
Say I was a lazy student. Practicing only the bare minimum and hitting around 1 hour day.
That would give 7 hours per week. 50 weeks per year (hey you need some breaks as well right?)
would give 350 hours per year. For 3 years, 1050 hours. 

Oh, so that ratio is quite interesting. Even for a lazy student. **1-2 hours of game per 
1050 hours of practice!**
