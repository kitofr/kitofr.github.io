# The learning organization 
“Some organizations choose also to train everybody in frontline skills. At FAVI, the French automotive supplier, all engineers and administrative workers have been trained to operate at least one machine on the shop floor. The training is regularly put to good use: when orders must be rushed out, it happens that all hands get called on deck. White-collar workers come down from the office space on the first floor to man the machines for a few hours. It’s a wonderful community-building practice. People in engineering and administrative roles work under the guidance of the machine operators. They witness first-hand how hard the work on the machines can be and how much skill it involves. At the end of the day, when the orders are out on time, colleagues share a sense of pride in the work accomplished.
At Sun Hydraulics, all new hires start with a “manufacturing tour,” no matter what their future role will be; they learn to operate not just one, but several work stations.

“In traditional organizations, training programs tend to fall into two categories:
Training that helps employees progress along the career ladder—training for young talents, first time managers, managers of managers, senior leaders, and so on. Green Organizations in particular dedicate much time and money toward training to help new managers deal gracefully with power and delegate much of it to their subordinates.

In self-managing organizations, the first category disappears; there are no training programs to help people climb the career ladder. Instead, Teal Organizations offer two types of training rarely found in traditional organizations: training to establish a common culture, and personal development training.”
